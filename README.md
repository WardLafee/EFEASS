# efeass

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

In this project we need to discover more about you and your style of code ,and the most important we need to explore how much you can learn when needed.

1. Check API documentation for COUNTRIES & CITIES API --> Filter URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52#c5cf3bfe-3c14-4167-ac6a-6f84c8b0d6b0
2. It is a JSON API that allows user to get specific data about countries.
3. The API got multi query parameters that can be passed in, for example
to get countries currency & dialcode you can pass in the following url https://countriesnow.space/api/v0.1/countries/info?returns=currency,dialcode

4. Create a very simple site that allow the user to :
     i. Select which fields would like to get its data, minimum checkboxes to show to user will be :
       a.   currency
       b.  dialcode
       c. flag
       -there are alot more try to add any
    ii. On Submit , your simple site will get the data and display it in human-readable format "html bullets could be good idea"
   iii. Feel free to do it in a language of your choosing.
    iv. Provide your ABOUT.md and explain why you picked this language you did
5. Push your code to GitHub
6. Document the instructions for setting the site up in a local sandbox in your README.md file. withh all assumptions you've made about the API or the runtime environment.
7. Document any known issues with your code.
